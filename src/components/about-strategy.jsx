      "BOSAG will activate a strategic global visibility plan including the launch of the national Ghana GBS/BPO Value Proposition, international client events, and the establishment of overseas offices in priority markets. It will also produce case studies, success stories, and client conversion tools. Notably, a concierge support programme for visiting investors will be established to strengthen conversion and confidence. This pillar is the primary lever for attracting new international demand (including GBS/BPO buyers, Global Capability Centres (GCCs), and remote work platforms) and will be central to job growth.",

It also supports embedding GBS-focused curricula into universities, offering scholarships, and driving sector certifications. A new initiative will focus on preparing workers for placement through remote-first talent platforms (such as Remote4Africa, FlexJobs and Yoummday). BOSAG’s approach to skills is scalable, inclusive, and designed to match employers’ evolving needs, particularly in customer support, automation, cloud, and AI-aligned job roles.",

    content:
      "BOSAG will implement a national “Think Local, Source Local” campaign, expand public sector outsourcing models, and promote local operator success stories. At the same time, local firms will benefit from quarterly bootcamps, mentorship pairings, legal literacy tools, contract templates, and ISO certification support. These initiatives will be reinforced by access to AI testing through the national AI Hub and peer-led Special Interest Groups. By supporting both demand and supply readiness, this pillar positions local operators to grow sustainably, secure anchor clients, and transition into globally competitive service providers.",

    content:
      "Actions include quarterly roundtables with ministries, a regulatory task force, and active participation in national strategy formulation. BOSAG will advocate for enabling incentives (e.g., tax exemptions, licensing streamlining) and represent the sector in regional and multilateral platforms. The strategy also promotes alignment with AfCFTA for regional service alignment. Strengthening public-private dialogue and embedding BOSAG in formal consultation processes will help reduce policy lag, improve sector responsiveness, and foster a more predictable business environment. In this regard, BOSAG should also establish proxy GBS desks/points of presence at the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC) and Ghana Free Zones Authority (GFZA).",

A key initiative will be to offer feasibility and market entry support for global investors and Global Capability Centres (GCCs) or Shared Services Centres (SCCs) considering Ghana. BOSAG will also build a central repository of tools and templates for operators, while leading national benchmarking efforts.
